        <h1>Crackers</h1>
        <p>is used to describe an individual who engages in breaching computer systems or computer networks with
          malicious fines. Unlike ethical hackers, crackers use their skills to commit computer crimes, such as stealing
          information, installing malware, or destroying systems.

          It is important to note that the term "cracker" is less common than the term "hacker", and is used primarily
          to distinguish individuals who use their computer skills for criminal purposes from those who do so for
          ethical or constructive purposes. Most people involved in computer security prefer to use the term "hacker" to
          refer to all people with advanced computer skills, regardless of whether their intentions are ethical or not.
        </p>

        <h1>difference</h1>

        <p>Therefore, unlike hackers, their goals are almost always malicious. Crackers use their technical knowledge
          exclusively to invade systems, crack keys and passwords, steal data and other illicit digital uses. Its modus
          operandi is based on exploiting the vulnerabilities of computer programs and systems, stealing private
          information to make personal and malicious use of it.

          <br>
          <br>

          As for their objectives, they are usually related to profit, although sometimes they act for the simple
          challenge of breaking these security barriers.
