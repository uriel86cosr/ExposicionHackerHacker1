        <h1>¿What is a hacker?</h1>
        <p>A hacker is a person with advanced skills in the use of computers and technology, who uses their knowledge to
          explore and improve computer systems. The term "hacker" has both positive and negative connotations, depending
          on the context. Some hackers are dedicated to creating software and tools that improve the security or
          efficiency of systems, while others use their skills to breach the security of other people's systems for
          criminal or malicious purposes.

          It is important to distinguish between ethical hackers, who are dedicated to improving system security and
          detecting vulnerabilities, and malicious hackers, who use their skills for illegal or harmful purposes.</p>
